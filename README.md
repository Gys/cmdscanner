# cmdscanner - Go Module Dependency Scanner

A command-line tool that parses Go module files (`go.mod`) and scans all dependencies for command pattern usage. It identifies and extracts code lines containing specific command patterns like `.Command(`, `.RunCommand(`, and `.Cmd(`.

## Why

Bad actors copy popular GitHub projects, add faked stars for credibility and then injected malicious code at runtime. Attackers obfuscate their code but a common pattern is executing the command in the shell. This tool hopefully helps identify unexpected shell access from dependencies of a Golang project.

**A typical use case is to run this tool on a project directly after adding a new dependency.**

See this discussion on Reddit: [Someone copied our GitHub project, made it look more trustworthy by adding stars from many fake users, and then injected malicious code at runtime for potential users.](https://old.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1jbzuot/someone_copied_our_github_project_made_it_look/)

## Features

- Parse `go.mod` files to extract module information
- List all direct and indirect dependencies
- Show the exact filesystem location where each dependency is installed
- Verify if dependencies are actually present on disk
- Handle replace directives and show replacement locations
- **Scan all Go files in dependencies for specific command patterns**:
  - `.Command(`
  - `.RunCommand(`
  - `.Cmd(`
- **Extract and display the actual lines of code containing these patterns**
- Generate a detailed summary of all matching files and code lines
- Group and count occurrences by pattern type
- **Skip test files (`*_test.go`) to focus on implementation code**
- **Optionally skip official Go packages (`golang.org/*`)**
- **Optionally skip user-specified packages**

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cmdscanner
cd cmdscanner

# Build the application
go build -o cmdscanner
```

## Usage

```bash
# Scan the first found go.mod file in the current directory or parent directories
./cmdscanner

# Scan a specific go.mod file
./cmdscanner -file /path/to/go.mod

# Also include official Go packages (*.golang.org/*)
./cmdscanner -include-go-official

# Skip specific packages (comma-separated list)
./cmdscanner -skip github.com/spf13/cobra,github.com/pkg/errors
```

## Example Output

```
Module: github.com/example/myproject
Go version: 1.20
Module cache location: /home/user/go/pkg/mod
Searching for command patterns: .Command(, .RunCommand(, .Cmd(
Skipping test files (*_test.go)
Skipping official Go packages (golang.org/*)
Skipping user-specified packages: github.com/spf13/cobra, github.com/pkg/errors

## Technical Notes

### Source

95% of this code and the README.md are generated by Claude 3.7 Sonnet, using Cody in VS Code.

### Command Pattern Detection

The tool looks for these command patterns:
- `.Command(`
- `.RunCommand(`
- `.Cmd(`

### Test File Exclusion

The tool skips all files ending with `_test.go` to focus on implementation code. 

### Go Official Package Inclusion

With the `-include-go-official` flag, the tool will include scanning packages from the Go project itself (those with paths starting with `golang.org/`).

### Package Skipping

Use the `-skip` flag to specify a comma-separated list of packages to skip during scanning.

### Go Module Cache

Go stores downloaded packages in a central module cache. The location of this cache is determined by:

1. The `GOMODCACHE` environment variable (Go 1.14+)
2. Fallback: `$GOPATH/pkg/mod` (older Go versions)

You can find your module cache location by running:

```bash
go env GOMODCACHE
```

### Module Path Encoding

Module paths in the filesystem are encoded to handle special characters:

- Uppercase letters are converted to '!' followed by the lowercase letter
- The '!' character is converted to '!!'
- Other special characters may also be encoded

Our tool handles this encoding automatically using Go's `module.EscapePath` function.

### Version Handling

Module versions in the filesystem may have special suffixes:

- `+incompatible` suffix for modules that don't follow semantic versioning
- Pseudo-versions like `v0.0.0-20230822171919-f59e071c2a15`

The tool handles these special cases when determining installation paths.

### Replace Directives

Replace directives in `go.mod` files can point to:

1. Another module version (stored in the module cache)
2. A local filesystem path (not in the module cache)

The tool distinguishes between these cases and shows the appropriate location.

### File Scanning

The tool recursively scans all `.go` files in each dependency's directory:

- It skips directories like `.git`, `testdata`, and `vendor`
- It skips test files (`*_test.go`)
- It optionally includes official Go packages (`golang.org/*`)
- It searches for the specified command patterns in each Go file
- It extracts and displays the actual lines of code containing these patterns
- It provides a detailed summary of all matching files and code lines at the end
- It groups and counts occurrences by pattern type

### Extending the Command Patterns

To add more command patterns to search for, modify the `CommandPatterns` slice in the code:

```go
var CommandPatterns = []string{
    `.Command(`,
    `.RunCommand(`,
    `.Cmd(`,
    // Add more patterns here
    `.NewCommand(`,
    `.AddCommand(`,
}
```

### Vendoring

If your project uses vendoring (`go mod vendor`), dependencies are also copied to the `vendor` directory in your project. This tool focuses on the module cache, not vendored dependencies.

### Proxy Settings

Go may use a proxy for downloading modules (controlled by the `GOPROXY` environment variable). This doesn't affect where packages are stored locally, but it affects how they're downloaded.

### Sum Database

Go maintains a checksum database (`go.sum` file) to verify the integrity of modules. This is separate from the actual module storage.
